# Data-Analytics-using-PowerBI
The main objective of Concrete Strength Prediction is to detect the strength of concrete accurately and to minimize the time consumption for Civil Engineers. The best model will be helpful for civil engineers in choosing the appropriate concrete for bridges, houses construction.

Project Outcomes: Utilized techniques likes PowerBI for data visualization and used techniques like exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing for preparing the dataset. Multiple regression analysis is used to develop linear regression models for predicting compressive strength of concrete using four variables, namely, water-binder ratio, fine aggregate-binder ratio, coarse aggregate-binder ratio and binder content. Used RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R² score as evaluation metrics. We attained an accuracy of 62%.
